images of stars are generated using ScopeSim :cite:`Leschinski2020`.

Creating Source Objects
-----------------------

ScopeSim requires one source object for each simulated star. Source objects contain spatial and spectral information.
The spatial information consists of x and y in arcsec relative to the FOV axis, here generated by a chain of transformations from GCA to HTP and stored in the approprate database table.

The spectral information is aquired using multiple functions from the ScopeSim Templates library involving the following steps:

1. The spectral type of a star is determined by looking up the closest spectral type from "A Modern Mean Dwarf Stellar Color and Effective Temperature Sequence" :cite:`Mamajek2013` given its mass.
2. The spectrum is taken from Pickles catalogue :cite:`Pickles1998` requireing metalicity in range 0.5 - 2 solar and age of about 5 Gyr.
3. That spectrum is scaled such that it has 0 apparent Vega mag in the V filter.
4. The absolute magnitude :math:`M_V` of the star in the V filter is determined from its mass using :cite:`Mamajek2013` with linear interpolation.
5. The apparent magnitude :math:`m_V` is obtained from :math:`m_V = M_V + 5\log_{10}\left ( d \right )-5`
6. The interstellar exctinction :math:`e` is taken into account using :cite:`Marshall2006`
7. The weight :math:`w` of the spectrum :math:`s` is defined as

..  math::
    F\left (x,y \right ) = s * w

and calculated via

..  math::
    w = \frac{F}{F_0} = 10^{0.4\left ( m_0-(m_V+e) \right )}=10^{-0.4 (m_V+e)}
