The results presented, particularly :numref:`fig-25_precision`, indicate that data gathered with the ELT will indeed be accurate enough to study the IMF of YMCs near the GC.
However, it remains questionable if this is still the case for stars with mass :math:`<\0.08 [\textup{M}_\odot]`. 
Information about this mass regime, such as spectral type, MW disc and core IMFs are sparse. 
Moreover, the precision obtained here in the range :math:`0.5 - 0.08 [\textup{M}_{\odot}]` is already quite low.
That is not to say it wonâ€™t be possible. Many improvements and additions could be made to the presented work such as

#. A more accurate bulge model, for instance :cite:`Wang2012`
#. Additional snapshots to recover temporarily hidden stars and get a more accurate velocity estimation.
#. A sophisticated method for extracting positional data like point spread function fitting.
#. Accurately determine the ideal time step size.
