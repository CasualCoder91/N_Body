Tasks
=====
An overview of the tasks that we aim to complete:

Observations
------------
1. star catalogue of simulated open clusters
    - N-body simulations of cluster in free space
    - N-body simulations of cluster in galactic potential
    - Determine realistic initial conditions
    - Set realistic boundary conditions
    - Determine time span to look at - [0.1, 1, 10] years?

2. star catalogue for fore- and background stars in the galaxy
    - function for generating number of stars in a volume (dx, dy, dz)
      at any galactic position (x,y,z)

3. Images of clusters and on-sky scenes
    - Images/Movies of clusters evolving over time in free space
    - Images/Movies of field star population (evolving over time)
    - Images/Movies of clusters evolving over time with contaminating fore- and
      background stars

4. Mock observations of clusters
    - "Observations" of clusters evolving over time including all optical
      artifacts from atmosphere, telescope, instrument, etc
